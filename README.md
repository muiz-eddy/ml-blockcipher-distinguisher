# FYP_ML_Distinguisher

Final Implementation of ML BASED DISTINGUISHER and Strict Avalanche Criterion

This project is based on Baksi et al [2] studies on employing generic Machine Learning technique on lightweight Block Ciphers. In this project, the Block Cipher Algorithm tested are SPECK and PRESENT, the scope will be confined to Multilevel Perceptron with various configuration; other network types will not be tested or implemented. Due to restricted computational resources, this project does not test the machine learning technique's upper bound, and no key recovery attack will be used either. The input differential for SPECK and PRESENT is taken from another research article, and this paper will not discuss how the differential characteristic was obtained (tutorial on how to find differential characteristics can be referred to [5]).
